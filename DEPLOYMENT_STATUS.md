# FoundR Deployment Status

## Current Configuration

### GitHub Repository
- URL: https://github.com/gogs1998/FoundR.git
- Latest Commit: 56982bb - Fix Remix config for Cloudflare Pages

### Cloudflare Pages Settings
- Project Name: foundr
- Build Command: `npm run build`
- Build Output Directory: `public`
- Node Version: 18 (specified in .nvmrc)

## Deployment Issues

### Issue: Site Cannot Be Found

This typically means one of the following:

1. **Deployment is still in progress**
   - Check Cloudflare Pages dashboard for build status
   - Look for the deployment triggered by commit 56982bb

2. **Build failed**
   - Check deployment logs in Cloudflare Pages dashboard
   - Look for any new errors after the output directory fix

3. **Custom domain not configured**
   - Cloudflare assigns a default URL: `foundr.pages.dev` or `<project-name>.pages.dev`
   - Check what URL you're trying to access

4. **Missing Functions/_worker.js**
   - Remix on Cloudflare Pages needs a _worker.js or functions directory
   - May need to add Cloudflare adapter configuration

## Next Steps to Debug

1. **Check Cloudflare Dashboard**
   - Go to Cloudflare Pages dashboard
   - Find the "foundr" project
   - Check latest deployment status
   - Copy the deployment logs and share them

2. **Verify Build Output**
   - The build should create:
     - `public/` directory with static assets
     - `build/` directory with server code
     - A `functions/` directory or `_worker.js` for Cloudflare

3. **Check if Remix is configured for Cloudflare**
   - May need to verify remix.config.js has proper Cloudflare settings
   - May need a functions/_worker.js entry point
